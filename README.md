This repository has 3 files.

1. Endterm_Notebook.zip. It is the Jupyter notebook file with all the code and outputs.
2. Endterm_Notebook.ipynb - it is a notebook only with lines of code. It has no output, since I cleared the output so that the file could be uploaded to the Git.
3. Report_Big_Data_EndTerm.docx - document with a report of the project. It has all the screenshots of code+outputs in it. Also the description and goal.

That's it! Thank you for the attention. Have a nice day!

This is the notebook with the outputs. It weighs a lot, 188 MB, that's why it is in .zip format.
Didn't know how to upload it with all of the outputs. 
But next file is also .ipynb, and it has the code GitHub can open, but without outputs because the output weighted a lot.
If you want to see the outputs, download the .zip file.
If only the code - the other file, called Endterm_Notebook.ipynb
